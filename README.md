PODD Ontologies
===============

A set of ontologies used by the PODD system to standardise terminology used both internally by PODD and externally by scientists using PODD to store experimental information.

The ontologies are packaged and distributed as a Java JAR file, and deployed to Maven Central for general reuse. The ontologies may also be resolved using their URIs, with optional content negotiation to select from the different RDF formats available.
