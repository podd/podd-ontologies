PODD Ontologies
===============

A set of OWL ontologies used by the PODD system to standardise terminology used both internally by PODD and externally by scientists using PODD to store experimental information.

The ontologies are packaged and distributed as a Java JAR file, and deployed to Maven Central for general reuse. The ontologies may also be resolved using their URIs, with optional content negotiation to select from the different RDF formats available.

Contributing
============

Before contributing changes to these ontolgoies, it would be useful to [open an issue](https://github.com/podd/podd-ontologies/issues/new) with your proposed changes. This helps with coordinating merges back to the ontologies, and can stimulate discussion about the topic.
